Created GitHub account.
Downloaded and installed Visual Studio Code 1.964 version for Windows 11 opersting system. 
Used Excel to create csv file. 
Checked and made sure the student's names are spelt correctly.  Plus the headings subjects are spelt correctly.
used Visual Studio Code to create and run python coding.
Decided to use and do another python coding that will use indefinate loop function, to request for input data, before outputting the student grades.  
The Process_Data .py file successfully executed without any bugs.  Tested the program for error handling.  This included typing in non-numeric entries such as comma, numbers with a dash to it, the word hello, and that at symbol.  The program flagged these up as false inputs.  Program returned the request for user to input numerical grade or type exit to exit and end program. 
From this assignment, I discovered problem solving and knowledge of inductive reasoning methods being used for this assignment.  
My knowledge progression, based on doing research and doing the assignments using research and reading as my main tools still remains proof, studying and further self study is best practise.
